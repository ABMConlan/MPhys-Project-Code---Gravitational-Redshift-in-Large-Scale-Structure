# MPhys-Project-Code---Gravitational-Redshift-in-Large-Scale-Structure
The main analysis pipeline I implemented for my MPhys project. Written in Python from September 2022 to March 2023.

pointset.npy is not here, as it is too big for GitHub and is the 
intellectual property of the MultiDark Planck 2 simulation team.

deltar.npy and deltar_pert.npy contain all necessary data for visualising
the matter density contrast field, which can be done with the
datacubeImage() method.
